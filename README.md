# Project Path Advisor 🛠️

An intelligent tool that helps developers and project managers determine the optimal technical approach for their projects. Using natural language processing and customizable metrics, it provides tailored recommendations for project architecture and technology stack.

## Features ✨

- **Smart Scoring System**: Automatically evaluates project complexity across multiple dimensions
- **Interactive Refinement**: Fine-tune the analysis using intuitive sliders
- **Comprehensive Recommendations**: Get detailed advice on:
  - Starting point and architecture
  - Step-by-step implementation path
  - Suggested tools and technologies

## Quick Start 🚀

## How It Works 🔍

The Project Path Advisor analyzes your project requirements across five key dimensions:

1. **Data Complexity**: Evaluates the sophistication of your data structure needs
2. **Real-time Requirements**: Assesses the need for live updates and immediate data synchronization
3. **Automation Needs**: Measures the level of process automation required
4. **External Integrations**: Gauges the complexity of third-party service integration
5. **User Base Scale**: Considers the scale and concurrent user requirements

Based on these factors, it provides a recommended approach that best suits your project's needs.
